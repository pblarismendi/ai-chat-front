# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Chat Frontend project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the repository.

## Branch Strategy

- `master` is the main branch and is protected
- All changes must be made through Pull Requests
- Pull Requests to `master` require approval from the repository owner

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new branch from `master` with a descriptive name:

   - For features: `feature/your-feature-name`
   - For bugfixes: `fix/issue-description`
   - For documentation: `docs/what-you-documented`

2. Make your changes in your branch

3. Submit a Pull Request to the `master` branch

4. Wait for review and approval from the repository owner

5. Once approved, your changes will be merged into `master`

## Code Review Requirements

- All Pull Requests must be reviewed and approved by the repository owner before merging
- The repository owner can merge their own changes directly to `master` without review

## Questions?

If you have any questions about the contribution process, please open an issue with your question.
